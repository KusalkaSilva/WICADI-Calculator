# WICADI-Calculator

A University Group Project

The WiCaDi project implements a fully functional calculator from which it branch into 5 main sections;
    1.	Standard Calculator
    2.	Scientific Calculator (including Integration)
    3.	Graph Calculator
    4.	Programmer Calculator
    5.	Data Calculator
    
The above 5 main sections are extended into WiCaDi calculator and were implemented as 5 main interfaces. WiCaDi is developed to meet the requirements of creating formula, naming formula, saving formula, overriding formula, reading formula, delete formula, formula evaluation, integration, saving to a text file, reloading from a text file,  generating graphs, multiple graphs plotting, plotting integrals to graph, calculating area under the curve, saving graph to a file and display the history of user inputs.
